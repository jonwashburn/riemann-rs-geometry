### BSD proof-track: external dependency notes

This folder contains **audit notes** for external results used (explicitly or implicitly) by `BSD-Jon-Final.txt` and tracked in `BSD_Jon_Final_PROOF_TRACK.md`.

Goal: for each external paper/book result, record
- the **exact theorem statement** needed,
- the **hypotheses** (ordinary vs supersingular, exceptional zero exclusions, integrality normalizations, etc.),
- the **normalizations** (especially for \(p\)-adic logarithms/heights),
- and a **mapping** to the labels/lemmas in the proof track.

Start with the “core engine” references:
- Perrin–Riou explicit reciprocity / big logarithm
- Coleman–Gross / cyclotomic \(p\)-adic heights
- Greenberg control / local conditions
- Kato Euler system divisibility
- Poitou–Tate / Selmer complexes (Nekovář)
- Kobayashi/Pollack/Lei–Loeffler–Zerbes for signed supersingular theory

Second pass (high ROI for removing “disc pinch” conditionality):
- Recent IMC equality papers (2024–2025) that may replace the internal disc engine:
  - Yan–Zhu (arXiv:2412.20078)
  - Burungale–Castella–Skinner (arXiv:2405.00270)
  - Burungale–Skinner–Tian–Wan (arXiv:2409.01350)
  - Sprung (Adv. Math. 2024; `S0001870824002561`)
  - Castella (arXiv:2502.19618)
  - Keller–Yin (arXiv:2410.23241)
