### Keller–Yin (2024) — \(p\)-converse theorem at Eisenstein primes (ordinary potential)

#### Reference
- **Authors**: Timo Keller, Mulun Yin
- **Title**: “\(p\)-converse theorems for elliptic curves of potentially good ordinary reduction at Eisenstein primes”
- **arXiv**: `2410.23241`

#### Why this matters for the BSD proof track
Even if we import strong IMC equality theorems for “generic” primes (irreducible residual), we still need a strategy for the **finite exceptional set**:
- reducible/Eisenstein primes (e.g. rational \(p\)-isogeny),
- potentially good ordinary but non-generic deformation conditions.

This paper is a candidate for that “finite closure” step, reducing the remaining gaps to a finite set of explicit primes per curve.

#### What we need to extract (exact statements)
- The precise “\(p\)-converse” statement: what implication(s) from \(p\)-adic \(L\)-data to Selmer/BSD does it prove?
- Hypotheses: reduction type, residual representation, Eisenstein condition.
- Whether it gives BSD\(_p\) or only rank/size information.

#### Mapping into the proof track
- **Primary impacted labels**:
  - “Exceptional prime closure” for `cor:universal-bsd-p` and Appendix G
  - Any place the manuscript currently waves hands about “finite leftover primes handled by visibility/Kato” (this can strengthen/replace those handoffs)

#### Audit checklist (to fill)
- [ ] Extract theorem statements + hypotheses.
- [ ] Translate into BSD-Jon notation and identify which primes it covers.
- [ ] Decide whether it replaces (or complements) the manuscript’s current “visibility + Kato” closure.

#### Status
- **todo**
