### Castella (2025) — Perrin–Riou formula & signed Selmer characteristic series

#### Reference
- **Author**: Francesc Castella
- **Title**: “A formula of Perrin-Riou and characteristic power series of signed Selmer groups”
- **arXiv**: `2502.19618`

#### Why this matters for the BSD proof track
This looks directly aligned with the “signed/improved” part of the paper: it ties Perrin–Riou-type formulas to the **characteristic power series** of signed Selmer groups, and the abstract indicates it is motivated by \(p\)-adic BSD at supersingular primes.

Even if it doesn’t give full IMC equality by itself, it may provide:
- the missing **leading-term / characteristic-series identifications** in the signed setting,
- or a clean substitute for parts of Appendix F/C that are currently only sketched/cited.

#### What we need to extract (exact statements)
- The exact theorem(s) proved (Kundu–Ray conjecture / Perrin–Riou formula consequences).
- Any explicit comparison:
  - characteristic series of signed Selmer vs \(p\)-adic \(L\)-function(s),
  - or a precise BSD\(_p\) implication at supersingular primes.
- Hypotheses: reduction type, big image, Selmer conditions, etc.

#### Mapping into the proof track
- **Primary impacted labels**:
  - Signed IMC/BSD pipeline: `thm:universal-imc` (signed), `cor:universal-bsd-p`
  - Signed Perrin–Riou / height pieces (if it supplies clean comparisons): `lem:PR-signed-proof`, `thm:HL-signed` (depending on overlap)

#### Audit checklist (to fill)
- [ ] Extract the precise statement(s) and hypotheses.
- [ ] Identify what is conditional (if anything) on a main conjecture input.
- [ ] Record any normalization dictionary (sign conventions; \(L_p^\pm\); regulators).

#### Status
- **todo**
