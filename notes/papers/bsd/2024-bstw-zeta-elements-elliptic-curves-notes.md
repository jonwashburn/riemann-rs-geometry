### Burungale–Skinner–Tian–Wan (2024) — zeta elements for elliptic curves (supersingular relevance)

#### Reference
- **Authors**: Ashay Burungale, Christopher Skinner, Ye Tian, Xin Wan
- **Title**: “Zeta elements for elliptic curves and applications”
- **arXiv**: `2409.01350`
- **Note**: arXiv comment says a main result supersedes `arXiv:1411.6352` (Wan, supersingular IMC/BSD).

#### Why this matters for the BSD proof track
If this paper provides (or strengthens) **supersingular** IMC equality / BSD\(_p\) statements in a way that is uniform and citeable, it could replace the manuscript’s disc pinch on the **signed** branch and/or remove reliance on older supersingular inputs.

#### What we need to extract (exact statements)
- **Signed IMC equality at supersingular primes** (Kobayashi/Wan-style):
  - \(\mathrm{char}_\Lambda X_p^\pm = (L_p^\pm)\) up to \(\Lambda^\times\), with hypotheses.
- **BSD\(_p\) consequences**:
  - Any theorem asserting the \(p\)-part of BSD (rank/order + leading coefficient valuation equality) in supersingular settings.
- **Scope**:
  - Does it treat only \(a_p=0\) (automatic for \(p\ge 5\) supersingular elliptic curves over \(\mathbb Q\)), or also small primes / beyond \(a_p=0\)?

#### Mapping into the proof track
- **Primary impacted labels**:
  - `thm:universal-imc` / `cor:disc-imc` (signed/supersingular branch)
  - `cor:universal-bsd-p` (signed primes)
- **Replacement plan**:
  - Use as the main cite for signed IMC equality wherever it applies, instead of any internal disc argument.

#### Audit checklist (to fill)
- [ ] Extract and restate the main supersingular IMC theorem(s).
- [ ] Record exact hypotheses (big image, local conditions, etc.).
- [ ] Check if it proves equality or only one divisibility.
- [ ] Identify how it handles exceptional zeros / improved objects.

#### Status
- **todo**
