### Sprung (2024) — supersingular IMC “beyond \(a_p=0\)” (Advances in Mathematics)

#### Reference
- **Author**: Florian Sprung
- **Title**: “On Iwasawa main conjectures for elliptic curves at supersingular primes: Beyond the case \(a_p=0\)”
- **Venue**: *Advances in Mathematics* (2024)
- **ScienceDirect article id**: `S0001870824002561`

#### Why this matters for the BSD proof track
For elliptic curves over \(\mathbb Q\), supersingular primes \(p\ge 5\) automatically have \(a_p=0\), so “beyond \(a_p=0\)” is most relevant for:
- **small primes** \(p\in\{2,3\}\),
- or broader nonordinary settings / modular forms beyond the elliptic-curve case.

If this paper supplies an unconditional signed IMC equality statement covering the remaining small/special cases, it can help replace “disc pinch” claims at those primes.

#### What we need to extract (exact statements)
- Which main conjecture(s) are proved: plus/minus, multi-signed, or “signed Coleman” versions.
- Hypotheses: local conditions, residual image assumptions, \(p=2,3\) handling.
- Whether it proves **equality** or only one divisibility.

#### Mapping into the proof track
- **Primary impacted labels**:
  - `thm:universal-imc` (small-prime / supersingular cleanup)
  - `cor:universal-bsd-p` (if it gives BSD\(_p\) consequences)

#### Audit checklist (to fill)
- [ ] Locate a freely accessible preprint/PDF (author page or journal version) and extract the precise theorem statements.
- [ ] Translate to BSD-Jon notation and record which primes/cases are actually covered.

#### Status
- **todo**
