{\large Provisional Patent Draft}\\[2pt]
\end{center}

\section*{Field}
This disclosure relates to real-time scheduling for multi-actuator control systems. It provides a scheduler that enforces \emph{$\varphi$-commensurate} update windows, guarantees \emph{periodic invariance} and \emph{interference bounds} between actuators, and exposes a \emph{compliance API} that any controller (including MPC or RL) can use while proving adherence to the schedule. The scheduler is domain-agnostic and applies to fusion devices, high-power lasers, robotics, beamlines, power electronics, and other multi-actuator plants.

\section*{Background}
Multi-actuator systems suffer cross-interference when control updates align unfavorably with plant modes. Conventional schedulers use fixed or equal-spaced slots that can reinforce low-order modal coupling and lack portable guarantees or machine-verifiable compliance. There is a need for a reusable module that (i) desynchronizes updates via irrational-ratio timing, (ii) guarantees periodic invariance for control proofs and certification, (iii) bounds interference, and (iv) provides a simple API and audit trail.

\section*{Summary}
A \emph{$\varphi$-scheduler} partitions each control period into phase windows with durations related by the golden ratio $\varphi=\tfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, assigns actuators to phase sets, and \emph{enforces} that setpoint updates occur only within assigned windows. The schedule is \emph{periodic invariant} with declared period and jitter bounds. For band-limited plant/actuator couplings, the scheduler yields a \emph{quantified interference bound} on time-averaged bilinear cross-terms. A \emph{compliance API} and cryptographically signed logs allow third-party controllers to plug in while proving conformity.

\section*{Definitions}
\noindent\textbf{$\varphi$-commensurate windows.} Let $T>0$ be a control period. Define windows $W_0,\dots,W_{L-1}$ with durations $\Delta t_\ell>0$ such that
\[
\sum_{\ell=0}^{L-1}\Delta t_\ell = T,\qquad \frac{\Delta t_{\ell+1}}{\Delta t_\ell}\in\{\varphi,\varphi^{-1}\}\ \text{for admissible }\ell,
\]
with wrap-around interpreted modulo $L$ and optional subperiod patterns (e.g.\ $L=8$).\\[4pt]
\textbf{Actuator phase sets.} Each actuator $a$ is assigned $\Pi(a)\subseteq\{0,\dots,L-1\}$. Updates to $a$ may be applied only during windows $W_\ell$ with $\ell\in\Pi(a)$ and must satisfy dwell and slew constraints.\\[4pt]
\textbf{Periodic invariance.} The schedule repeats every $T$ with bounded jitter $\epsilon_j$ and supports periodic terminal sets/arguments in control proofs.\\[4pt]
\textbf{Interference bound (qualitative).} For band-limited cross-coupling kernels between actuators, the scheduler ensures a strict bound
\[
\langle \text{cross-term}\rangle \le \kappa\,\langle \text{baseline cross-term}\rangle,
\]
with $0<\kappa<1$ determined by window smoothness and spectral separation, providing a guaranteed reduction relative to co-phased or equal-spaced updates.\\[4pt]
\textbf{Compliance API.} A programmatic interface that (i) issues window entry/exit events, (ii) accepts or rejects update requests according to $\Pi(a)$ and timing, and (iii) produces signed compliance records.

\section*{Detailed Description of Embodiments}
\subsection*{Scheduler Core}
Given $T$ and $L$, the scheduler constructs $\Delta t_{0:L-1}$ satisfying $\varphi$-commensurability and maps actuators $a$ to $\Pi(a)$. A high-resolution clock triggers \emph{BeginWindow($\ell$)} and \emph{EndWindow($\ell$)}. Update requests \emph{RequestUpdate($a$, payload)} are admitted only if the current window index $\ell\in\Pi(a)$ and actuator dwell/slew constraints are satisfied.

\subsection*{Periodic Invariance and Multi-Rate}
The scheduler supports superframes of duration $S\,T$ with $S\in\mathbb{N}$, preserving $\varphi$-relations within each $T$. Jitter $\epsilon_j$ is bounded by hardware timers or RTOS guarantees, enabling periodic MPC/RL safety proofs with phase-dependent terminal sets.

\subsection*{Interference Bounds}
For plants with dominant modal content below a cutoff, the scheduler’s irrational timing and window smoothness avoid low-order reinforcement. Over each period (or superframe), the time-averaged magnitude of bilinear cross-terms is reduced by a strict factor $\kappa\in(0,1)$ relative to co-phased or equal-spaced baselines. The factor is scheduler-intrinsic and controller-agnostic.

\subsection*{Compliance and Audit}
The compliance API exposes: \emph{WindowIndex()}, \emph{Allowed($a$)}, \emph{RegisterUpdate($a$)}, and \emph{GetComplianceReport()}. The report includes window timings, admitted/rejected updates, actuator IDs, and cryptographic signatures, enabling certification and infringement testing. A hardware embodiment may use FPGA timers and secure elements for signing.

\subsection*{Example Domains}
\emph{Fusion:} gate NBI/ECRH/ICRH/RMP/pellets. \emph{ICF:} gate sub-pulse timings. \emph{Robotics:} desynchronize multi-axis torque updates. \emph{Power electronics:} gate converter switching setpoint updates. \emph{Beamlines/manufacturing:} stagger multi-actuator adjustments to reduce coupling.

\section*{Advantages}
The module is plug-and-play, controller-agnostic, and portable. It guarantees schedule properties needed for control proofs, reduces cross-interference by design, and produces verifiable compliance artifacts.
